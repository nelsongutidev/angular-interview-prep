# Angular Interview Prop

Interviews for an Angular Engineer/Developer position, in my experience, have been more of a conversation that a set of predefined questions. This repo contains topics, ideas and conversations starters that I have used and been part of as a interviewer and also when been interviewed.

## Fundamentals

### HTML, CSS and Javascript

In 90% of my Front End develop interviews I have applied for, a good understading of the fundamentls has been key to start of the interview with the right foot.

## Angular

### Angular framework

Conversation starters:

Q. What is Angular? 
- A component-based framework for building scalable web applications
- A collection of well-integrated libraries that cover a wide variety of features, including routing, forms management, client-server communication, and more

Q. What do you like about Angular?

A.
